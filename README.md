## 🚀 Installation & Deployment

To run this project locally:

1. Download the `.zip` file and extract its contents.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. For full `.htaccess` protection to work, host the project on a service like:
   - 000WebHost
   - Hostinger
   - GoDaddy
   - Apache-based hosting

For **live deployment**, the project is hosted on **Vercel** here:  
🔗 [https://snazzy-paws-assessmet3.vercel.app](https://snazzy-paws-assessmet3.vercel.app)

> ⚠️ Vercel does **not support `.htaccess`**, so JavaScript login was used as an alternative.

---

## 🔐 Access Control

As part of the assessment requirements, a **protected Staff Roster page** was implemented using two methods:

### 1. `.htaccess` and `.htpasswd` (Apache Only)

This is the standard method for protecting directories and files. It’s included in the ZIP version of the project and works with compatible web hosts.

### 2. JavaScript Login (Used for Vercel)

Due to Vercel's limitations, a JavaScript-based login system was implemented for demonstration purposes. This version checks hardcoded credentials before displaying the roster.

**Credentials:**

Username: snazzy  
Password: paws123
